Forgot to show two very important functionalities during presentation


---> Search functionality-users and sellers can search for sneakers through the search bar but only through brand name of the sneaker. Future developments will include sort by colour, size and release dates

---> Add Shoe functionality- a seller can POST a shoe but only after logging in. Required fields such as name, image url and soe size will pop up in a form where upon adding the listing will be registered on the backend and be available for purchase


THANK YOU!
